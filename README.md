1. Create a function that takes an unlimited amount of number parameters, and returns an array of all the permutations possible.

For example, myFunction(4, 7, 2) {} should return [472, 427, 724, 742, 247, 274].

2. Create a function that can find the Nth smallest number in an array. The array can be very very big, so you are not allowed using the Array.sort() method. Try to build a function that would perform fast.

Also, explain why using Array.sort() isn't a good idea when sorting large arrays.
